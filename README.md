The sun was shining on the sea, 
Shining with all his might: 
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright--  
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done--
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"

The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead--
There were no birds to fly.

The ~~Walrus~~ **KMan** and the ~~Carpenter~~ **Jagavkar**
Were walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see
~~Such quantities of sand:~~
**Servers scattered like sand**:
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand!"

"If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year.
Do you suppose," the ~~Walrus~~ **KMan** said,
"That they could get it clear?"
"I doubt it," said the ~~Carpenter~~ **Jagavkar**,
And shed a bitter tear.

"O ~~Oysters~~ **servers**, come and walk with us!"
The ~~Walrus~~ **KMan** did beseech.
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each."

"Do you see this?", the ~~Walrus~~ **KMan** said
Pointing to his slides
I have here a template,
I wrote it down in SAM,
My functions, tables, APIs, ...
My whole serverless stack!

"You package it, you deploy it"
CloudFormation does it all,
"Aha aha aha ..." said the ~~Carpenter~~ **Jagavkar**
"I want to try this now,"
I hope this makes it easier,
I guess I'll try it now!
 
The eldest ~~Oyster~~ **server** looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest ~~Oyster~~ **server** winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head--
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the ~~oyster-bed~~ **DC rack**.

But four young ~~Oysters~~ **servers** hurried up,
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat--
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.

Four other ~~Oysters~~ **servers** followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more--
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.

The ~~Walrus~~ **KMan** and the ~~Carpenter~~ **Jagavkar**
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little ~~Oysters~~ **servers** stood
And waited in a row.

"The time has come," the ~~Walrus~~ **KMan** said,
"To talk of many things:
Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
Of cabbages--and kings--
**Of CloudFormation and CodeCommit 
Of CodePipeline and CodeBuild**

And why the sea is boiling hot--
And whether pigs have wings."

"But wait a bit," the ~~Oysters~~ **servers** cried,
"Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!"
"No hurry!" said the ~~Carpenter~~ **Jagavkar**.
They thanked him much for that.

~~"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said~~,
"A build project," the **KMan** said,
"Is what we chiefly need:
~~Pepper and vinegar besides~~
**CodeCommit and CodePipeline besides** 
Are very good indeed--
Now if you're ready, ~~Oysters~~ **servers** dear,
We can begin to feed."

"But not on us!" the ~~Oysters~~ **servers** cried,
Turning a little blue.
"After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!"
"The night is fine," the ~~Walrus~~ **KMan** said.
"Do you admire the view?

"It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!"
The ~~Carpenter~~ **Jagavkar** said nothing but
"Cut us another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deaf--
I've had to ask you twice!"

"It seems a shame," the ~~Walrus~~ **KMan** said,
"To play them such a trick,
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!"
The ~~Carpenter~~ **Jagavkar** said nothing but
"The butter's spread too thick!"

"I weep for you," the ~~Walrus~~ **KMan** said:
"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.

"O ~~Oysters~~ **servers** ," said the ~~Carpenter~~ **Jagavkar**,
"You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none--
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one.
